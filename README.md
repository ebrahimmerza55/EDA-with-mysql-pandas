## About Dataset 
## Selected Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago

The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal.
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship.

A detailed description of the dataset can be found on [the city of Chicago's website](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01), but to summarize, the dataset has the following variables:

*   **Community Area Number** (`ca`): Used to uniquely identify each row of the dataset

*   **Community Area Name** (`community_area_name`): The name of the region in the city of Chicago

*   **Percent of Housing Crowded** (`percent_of_housing_crowded`): Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room

*   **Percent Households Below Poverty** (`percent_households_below_poverty`): Percent of households living below the federal poverty line

*   **Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed** (`percent_aged_16_unemployed`): Percent of persons over the age of 16 years that are unemployed

*   **Percent Aged 25+ without High School Diploma** (`percent_aged_25_without_high_school_diploma`): Percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school education

*   **Percent Aged Under** 18 or Over 64:Percent of population under 18 or over 64 years of age (`percent_aged_under_18_or_over_64`): (ie. dependents)

*   **Per Capita Income** (`per_capita_income_`): Community Area per capita income is estimated as the sum of tract-level aggragate incomes divided by the total population

*   **Hardship Index** (`hardship_index`): Score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators

So we gonna make some analysis using MySQL and Pandas to answer some questions:
* How many rows are in the dataset?
* How many community areas in Chicago have a hardship index greater than 50.0?
* What is the maximum value of hardship index in this dataset?
* Which community area which has the highest hardship index?
* Which Chicago community areas have per-capita incomes greater than $60,000?
* Create a scatter plot using the variables per_capita_income_ and hardship_index. Explain the correlation between the two variable
